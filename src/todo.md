# TODO

- fix bug where esc resets to stale position when scaling after a move; snapshot should store everything
- scale shape
- rotate shape
- view modes (wireframe, solid, textures)
- copy/paste
- undo/redo
- make move/scale/rotate damping vary with camera zoom
- refine movement to work with camera angles
  - (e.g. if you're looking at it from the other side, movement should be reversed)
