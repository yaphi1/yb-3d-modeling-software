# TODO

- selectable list of scene objects in sidebar
- multiselect/multi-edit
- allow material reuse
- undo/redo
- allow multiple save files
- persist saves in filesystem instead of localStorage
- consider adding more example textures and example models
- refine movement to work with camera angles
  - (e.g. if you're looking at it from the other side, movement should be reversed)
- rotate shape
